C5VRX-5 receives analog 5.8 GHz FPV video with the ESP32-C5's own radio and
outputs composite PAL/NTSC through a passive 6-bit resistor DAC: automatic
gain control, a quick baseline boot with manual calibration, an on-screen
menu, and browser-based flashing and controls.

The demodulator is **U80P64-R1** ([evidence and limits](docs/P64.md)). It has
one positive NTSC check; PAL, weak-signal behaviour and range still need
hardware validation. Board findings, including the retired U85Q/kp/LP models
and the removed sync flywheel, are in [docs/FINDINGS.md](docs/FINDINGS.md).

## Experimental firmware — flight safety warning

> [!WARNING]
> **C5VRX is an experimental FPV receiver. Bugs, signal loss, automatic
> receive-chain changes or incompatibility with your camera/goggles can cause
> sudden loss of video or sync, even after an apparently successful test.
> Loss of FPV video can lead to a crash, property damage or serious injury.**
> Do not rely on C5VRX as your only means of maintaining safe control of an aircraft.

- **Test every firmware, hardware and settings combination on the ground
  first**, propellers removed: startup, calibration, weak signal, recovery
  after video loss, with your own camera and goggles.
- **Keep disruptive actions on the ground.** Calibration, scanning, channel
  changes, the menu, DAC tests and diagnostics can interrupt the picture;
  never flash or run bench tests in flight.
- **Automatic changes are experimental too.** Live filter/profile switching
  (default on; console `A` turns it off, `T` shows the state) and live
  OUTPUT/format changes restart part of the pipeline and may interrupt video.
- **Fly tests in a controlled area** clear of people, traffic and property,
  close by, with a safe way to recover if video disappears, and within local
  rules (visual line of sight, observers).
- **A release, a "Latest" label or green CI is not flight qualification.**
  PR builds are development builds; a test of an earlier build does not
  validate later changes.
- **Report video loss** with the exact firmware version, hardware, settings,
  steps and any logs/DVR footage, and investigate on the ground before flying
  again.

The firmware is provided under [GPL-3.0-only](LICENSE), including its warranty
and liability provisions in sections 15–17, to the extent permitted by
applicable law. This warning does not replace those terms or limit rights
that cannot legally be excluded.

## Hardware

A Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5 and seven resistors; no extra RF parts
([schematic](docs/hardware/c5vrx-dac-schematic.png)). Six resistors, one per
pin, join on one node, the CVBS output; the seventh loads that node to GND.

| XIAO pin | GPIO | DAC bit | Resistor to the output node |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| D4 | 23 | bit 0 (LSB) | 8.2 kΩ |
| D5 | 24 | bit 1 | 3.9 kΩ |
| D6 | 11 | bit 2 | 2.0 kΩ |
| D7 | 12 | bit 3 | 1.0 kΩ |
| D8 | 8 | bit 4 | 470 Ω |
| D9 | 9 | bit 5 (MSB) | 240 Ω |
| GND | - | load | 200 Ω (output node to GND) |

```
D4 --[8.2k]--+
D5 --[3.9k]--+
D6 --[2.0k]--+
D7 --[1.0k]--+-----------> CVBS out (goggle / monitor AV-in, video)
D8 --[470R]--+     |
D9 --[240R]--+   [200R]   (optional: 470 pF from the node to GND,
                   |        improvement unproven)
GND ---------------+------> GND (goggle / monitor AV-in ground)
```

- **Pin order matters**: 8.2k on D4, 240R on D9. A swapped pair gives a
  scrambled, banded picture.
- Connect the node to the video input (tip) of the goggles, DVR or monitor,
  with a common ground. Standard E24 1 % resistors are fine; keep the wires
  short. Power comes over USB-C or the 5 V pin.
- Too dim on some goggles: raise **OUTPUT** in the menu (0.5–5.0x, saved);
  high levels can clip.
- **Check the build with the DAC self-test** (`Z` or menu DAC TEST) before
  chasing picture problems: see
  [Building and testing the resistor DAC](docs/hardware/dac-build-and-test.md).

IQ routing is internal (no wiring) and uses GPIO27 (the user LED, which may
glow) and GPIO2. That keeps **D10/GPIO10 and D3/GPIO7 free for a future
seventh/eighth DAC branch** (15 kΩ and 33 kΩ, added as *low* bits). Leave
them **unpopulated**: the firmware is 6-bit, and the new IQ routes still need
board validation ([pin-routing findings](docs/FINDINGS.md#gpio27-iq-loopback-experiment-2026-10-25)).

### DIY Carrier PCB — REV C: Fat Shark Module + 3.5 mm AV Jack

**[C5VRX_JACK_DIY_V3 / REV C](hardware/C5VRX_JACK_DIY_V3)** is the latest proposed DIY carrier revision for the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5. It keeps the REV B layout (Fat Shark module-bay outline, 3.5 mm PJ-320D AV jack, reserved seventh/eighth DAC branches) and replaces the SJ1 bay-power solder bridge with a through-hole 1N5819 Schottky diode, so USB and the goggle bay can be connected at the same time.

  <img src="hardware/C5VRX_JACK_DIY_V3/exports/renders/02-back-perspective.png" alt="C5VRX REV C back with DAC jumpers" width="49%" />
</div>

| Feature | REV C details |
| --- | --- |
| **Form factor** | 42.51 × 28.80 mm; XIAO, AV jack and bay header keep their REV A positions |
| **AV output** | VIDEO on Fat Shark J1 pin 6 and PJ-320D tip + ring 1; ground on the jack sleeve |
| **Through-hole DAC** | DIN0207 axial ¼ W resistors; existing six branches and 200 Ω shunt retained |
| **Reserved DAC expansion** | R8: 15 kΩ from D10/GPIO10 via SJ2; R9: 33 kΩ from D3/GPIO7 via SJ3 |
| **Bay power** | D1: 1N5819 Schottky (DO-41, through-hole) from bay 5 V to XIAO 5 V; no jumper to open before USB programming |
| **Rear solder jumpers** | SJ2 / BIT 7 and SJ3 / BIT 8: extra DAC branches |
| **Artwork** | C5VRX logos on both sides; REV C and 6–8 BIT DAC markings on the back |

**Current firmware remains six-bit:** leave R8/R9 unpopulated and SJ2/SJ3 open. The jumpers connect hardware only; seven/eight-bit output still needs matching firmware and electrical validation. [Assembly and jumper settings](hardware/C5VRX_JACK_DIY_V3#dac-branches-and-rear-jumpers).

KiCad ERC/DRC and schematic/PCB parity checks are clean; REV C has not been built or measured. [REV B](hardware/C5VRX_JACK_DIY_V2) and the original [REV A carrier](hardware/C5VRX_JACK_DIY) remain available with their fabrication files.

## Flashing

- **Browser:** open the [web flasher](https://twotoz.github.io/C5VRX/) in
  desktop Chrome or Edge, choose **C5VRX-5** and a build, and flash. Use
  **Full firmware** when coming from another generation. **Local File**
  flashes your own `.bin`; **Legacy builds** holds archived C5VRX-3 firmware.
- **From source:** ESP-IDF **6.0.2** (filter and DC correction need its exact
  libphy; other versions build with them disabled and a warning):

  ```sh
  idf.py build
  python tools/flash.py PORT          # e.g. COM6 or /dev/ttyACM0
  ```

  Do not use `idf.py flash` on a running receiver: its USB line reset hangs
  the board until USB and battery are removed. `tools/flash.py` enters
  download mode through the firmware instead. Useful options: `--app-only`,
  `--monitor` / `--monitor-only`, `--log FILE`, `--iq DIR` (IQ snapshots),
  `--check` (boot, `T` and `D`; fails on a crash, wrong image or chain
  fault), `--no-key` (board already in the ROM loader). After
  `sdkconfig.defaults` changes, delete `sdkconfig` and rebuild.
- **XIAO ESP32-C5HR8 with 8 MB PSRAM** (optional; the standard image also
  runs without PSRAM, this one panics without it):

  ```sh
  idf.py -B build-psram -DSDKCONFIG=sdkconfig.psram "-DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.psram.defaults" build
  python tools/flash.py PORT --build build-psram --check
  ```

  Flash the full image when switching. Boot `heap_min` rose from ~2.1 KB to
  ~21.9 KB; PAL and long runs are pending
  ([measurements](docs/FINDINGS.md#psram-8-mb-on-the-xiao-now-mapped-board-2026-10-26)).

## First boot

1. The receiver loads saved settings or a fixed baseline; a short
   sampling-phase check runs under the boot logo. There is no automatic
   RF/DC sweep.
2. If repeated measurements show a poor baseline, the menu recommends
   **CALIBRATE**: run it on the ground, preferably with the VTX off. Full RF
   optimization (`B` / web controls) is a separate, longer bench operation.
3. Select the VTX channel or use SCAN (A1 without a saved channel).
4. **CALIBRATE → Download calibration report** in the web controls exports
   read-only board data ([protocol](docs/FASTER_CALIBRATION.md)).

## Controls

**BOOT button:** short press = next channel (menu: next item); hold 0.6 s =
open the menu (menu: select).

**Menu**, one list with every value in view: BAND, CHANNEL, SCAN, VIDEO
(AUTO/NTSC/PAL), FILTER (AUTO/XNARROW/NARROW/NORMAL/WIDE), PHY FILT
(digital filter mode), AFC (ON/OFF), CALIBRATE, OUTPUT (0.5–5.0x), GAIN
(LEVEL/KEEL/RSSI/MAX/fixed), DAC TEST, EXIT. It closes after 30 s of
inactivity (5 min in DAC TEST); entering and leaving can interrupt video.
GAIN defaults to **LEVEL**; KEEL and RSSI are kept for comparison
([AGC research](docs/FINDINGS.md)). The automatic models are remembered
across reboots; MAX and fixed gains never are.

**Serial console** (web flasher **Terminal** tab, or 115200 baud): keys are
case-sensitive, without Enter; `h` lists what your firmware supports.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `T` / `h` | Status / help |
| `b` / `c` / `s` | Next band / next channel / scan |
| `o` / `n` / `x` / `e` | Open menu / next item / select / exit |
| `v` / `g` / `G` | Video standard / output level / gain |
| `F` / `B` / `C` | Calibrate current filter / full RF optimization / read-only calibration report |
| `Z` | DAC self-test (ground only) |
| `D` / `R` | Health report / per-second field diagnostics |
| `I` / `M` / `L` | IQ snapshot / gain map / bench IQ lane test |
| `A` | Live filter/profile switching on/off (saved) |
| `S` + suite | Bench PHY sensitivity lab, VTX on ([docs](docs/PHY_SENSITIVITY_LAB.md); ground only) |
| `` ` `` | USB download mode |

Live OUTPUT and profile changes share a five-second cooldown and a verified
restart with rollback. The browser terminal and the flasher use the port one
at a time; **Download log** saves the last 120,000 characters.

`main/` is the C5VRX-5 firmware, `web/` the flasher, `test/` host tests,
`docs/` guides and findings, `research/` experiments, `tools/` console and CI
helpers; `legacy/` keeps C5VRX-1 to C5VRX-4 for reference (not built).

CI runs the host and research checks, builds with ESP-IDF 6.0.2 and publishes
`c5vrx5-v5.0.N` releases from `main` and `c5vrx5-pr-N` builds for PRs;
website-only changes create no firmware. Firmware PRs need board tests on the
matching build: host tests do not establish picture compatibility or range.
