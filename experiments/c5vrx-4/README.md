# C5VRX-4 integrated alpha

One isolated ESP32-C5 receiver project, assembled from the C5VRX-3 range/control
work and the three-bundle Phase8 Unwrap75 experiments. It extends **C5VRX by
Twotoz and the C5VRX contributors** and their receiver research.
Source: https://github.com/Twotoz/C5VRX · official website and Discord invite:

This directory contains its own runtime `main/`, configuration, partition table,
tests and evidence. It does not compile the repository's C5VRX-3 `main/`.
The integration PR changes only `experiments/c5vrx-4/`; merge requires the
operator's explicit approval. Building and publishing a PR alpha is independent
of merging. Current main's existing alpha workflow/flasher can build this project.

## Receiver contract

- MODEM_DIAG packed Q4/I4, positive-edge PARLIO RX at 40 MS/s, raw cyclic ring.
- TX-only Phase8 endpoint decode plus middle-sample quadrant winding; exactly
  three bundles per three input/output bytes. Unique CVBS 13.333 MS/s,
  continuous `[D,D,D]` at a 40 MHz / 40 MB/s physical DAC transport.
- Six original DAC GPIOs and resistor network; no CPU sample-paced output.
- Direct Gain V5 by default: first-window physical correction, 200-us observer,
  descriptor dedupe, table-maximum listening, measured noise lane cap and
  anti-hunt damping. Native AGC remains a separate opt-in gain owner.
- Fixed fine IQ lanes by default: ADC bits {9,7,6,5} on I and Q (step 32
  codes, signed window +-256), selected before PARLIO RX starts and never
  switched at runtime, for every gain owner. Analog gain does all amplitude
  tracking; its 13..32 P50 band is ~3.6-5.7 fine cells (~115-180 codes). With
  the measured ~35-code receiver noise at maximum gain, one fine step is close
  to one noise sigma: finer lanes add no phase information there but fold
  sooner, and coarse loses ~0.7 dB at the edge (host simulation, not a range
  measurement). Fixed ultrafine and protected adaptive V5 lanes remain Z
  comparisons.
- Severe clipping (>=50%, P95>=95) on the coarse or a fixed lane sends active
  Direct Gain to G20, its existing controller floor: a fixed lane has no
  escape lane. Moderate overload uses staged BB-first cuts. In the adaptive
  comparison finer-lane saturation first escapes to coarse. No native/manual
  gain writes.
- Fixed nominal loaded CVBS transfer STD150 (default): 0.310-V blanking +
  0.150 V/MHz, nearest DAC code with saturation. Assumed nominal sync/white
  targets are 0.010/1.010 V: 0.300 V sync depth and 1.000 V sync-to-white
  under one 75-ohm load. Replaces HR100's undersized output; full amplitude
  leaves only small rail margin, not broad CFO tolerance. CVBS150 and legacy
  remain M comparisons. See CVBS_OUTPUT.md for sources and physical limits.
- Slow sync supervision uses the same stride-3 Phase8/winding transfer estimate,
  instead of the old Phase5 shadow. Snapshot alignment remains approximate.
- AFC V2 measures burst-confirmed sync and burst-free porch, with both endpoints
  valid, bounded/stable 16-window evidence, context/settle/copy refusal and a
  maximum of four 250-kHz acquisition steps. AFC video TRACK is sticky and
  writes nothing while valid; it is independent of gain HOLD. **AUTO defaults
  off**: transmitter reference/sign still need physical calibration.
- PR154 PHY ownership restoration, serialized generation-checked gain writes,
  stale-overload mailbox rejection, reversible pinned PHY/BW/11p/native-hold labs.
- Tuning reaches 5945 MHz (R8, E6..E8) through `phy_set_freq` from the 5885 MHz
  centre, as zerowidth decoded R8; the old 5885 MHz ceiling is gone.
- Default-on digital DC recentring: the raw I/Q centre is averaged per
  gain/lane epoch from settled, unclipped observer windows; after two agreeing
  evaluations and a move of at least 0.12 cell (at most every 2 s) the static
  Phase8 decoder banks are rewritten around it through the verified LUT16
  path. No PHY writes, no raw-ring change; HISTORY decode refuses it. NVS
  `c5vrx4/dc_recenter=0` (`%`) opts out.
- Default-on first-lock sampling-phase check: one glitch measurement at the
  first stable carrier HOLD; only >=5000 ppm mid-transition reads trigger the
  RX clock-slip scan. NVS `c5vrx4/sphase_auto=0` (`&`) opts out.
- Default-on fixed analog bandwidth replaces the BW20/BW40 gear, which only
  moved the digital filter. It builds on [ESPARGOS esp-sdr](https://github.com/ESPARGOS/esp-sdr)'s C5 `BANDWIDTH`
  control (absolute RX0 capacitor code in BBTOP 0x67 regs 6/7, noise-FFT
  width curves, commit `ac627b0b`) and on [zerowidth/C5VRX PR #3](https://github.com/zerowidth/C5VRX/pull/3)'s measured noise reduction from a
  narrower filter. Without a carrier at maximum gain the receiver-noise width
  is measured on this chip for the calibrated bytes and codes 0..60, matched
  against both esp-sdr curves, and the narrowest code still >=24 MHz (the
  widest if none reaches it) is stored (NVS `bw_code`, `bw_width`) and
  re-applied at boot and on every retune. C5VRX's own `WIFI_BW20` test lost
  detail and chroma, hence the 24 MHz floor. Runs automatically once (VTX
  off); `=` repeats it, NVS `c5vrx4/fixed_bw=0` (`^`) restores the gear.
- Native AGC acquisition mask (native mode, default on once calibrated): the
  C5 packet AGC re-acquires every ~25-50 us with a ~2-3 us saturated/starved
  gain walk. A MODEM_DIAG AGC state bit, found by an on-board witness
  calibration (`*`, automatic at the first native carrier), rides on PARLIO
  data bit 0 (Q LSB) and the STATIC program holds the last DAC value through
  every walk, reseeding phase so the next clean span is exact. Native keeps
  its sub-line reaction; `|` opts out. See NATIVE_AGC_MASK.md.
- No-carrier idle raster (default on, for HDZero/TP2825 goggles): after 2 s
  without any carrier or sync, the standalone BT.470 raster sends clean black
  video in the live/last stable standard instead of demodulated noise, so the
  goggles neither show green nor switch PAL/NTSC. The first carrier or sync
  returns to live video. The last stable standard is kept in NVS. `_` opts
  out. See HDZERO.md.
- The sync-referenced level servo (`u`) now also runs under native AGC (and
  with the native acquisition mask, which decodes Q3 in every CPU snapshot),
  so VTX deviation and carrier offset are corrected in every gain mode. See
  HDZERO.md for the HDZero cause analysis.
- V5 strong-signal radius boost (default on): on a strong, tight, rail-free
  carrier the healthy P50 band moves from 13..32 to 30..46 (IQ ring ~200
  instead of ~150 codes), so the 4-bit phase is finer. The first rail code,
  P95 or level jump returns to the normal band at once. `y` opts out. See
  RADIUS_BOOST.md.
- Pre-demodulation labs (`!`, `@`, `#`, `$`) measure sampling phase, DC centring
  and filter width. See PREDEMOD_LAB.md.
- Main's analog-video scanner confidence and centred-RF tie-break are retained.
  They identify candidate channels; a confident scan is not range proof.

## Operator controls

The lane policy uses the NVS key `c5vrx4/lane_mode` (0 fixed fine, 1 fixed
ultrafine, 2 protected V5); the older `force_ultra_v2` and PR146 `force_ultra`
comparison keys are ignored, so an earlier test setting cannot override fixed fine.
Other C5VRX-4 settings remain in `c5vrx4`, separate from C5VRX-3 `c5vrx`.
STATIC remains the default; HISTORY, fixed ultrafine and adaptive lanes are comparisons.
Normal probes are disabled at boot. Lab writes require the pinned PHY archive;
unknown libraries keep observation and refuse undocumented writes.

## Build and verification

```sh
cd experiments/c5vrx-4
python3 verify.py
. "$IDF_PATH/export.sh"  # ESP-IDF v6.0.2
idf.py -DIDF_TARGET=esp32c5 build
```

IDF configuration invokes `verify.py`, so the existing alpha workflow executes
this directory's C regressions, AFC cases, Phase8/routing tests and exhaustive
524,386,048-trajectory oracle before cross-compiling. Host Python 3 and GCC are
required; this verification does not need NumPy, network access or hardware.
Generated tables must match checked-in artifacts. No binaries are committed.
The supervisory task stack is 16 KiB to accommodate the bounded snapshot
analyzer; startup refuses allocation failure. The separate adaptive 5/20-ms level worker uses another 16-KiB stack and an 8190-byte heap
snapshot; J capture also has a 16-KiB stack. Heap/stack margin under menu and
concurrent capture still needs hardware observation; T reports level-worker margins.

Earlier research files are donor records; this README defines current defaults.

## Evidence boundary

This is an unmerged test build. Host tests and compiler success do not establish
sample-gapless transport, improved sensitivity/range, PAL/NTSC compliance or
HDZero acceptance. Fixed scaling does not recover phase information lost to
clipping, origin collapse or RF noise. Automatic sync-referenced video level regulation is enabled by default at Leon's
request. It targets 286/300-mV NTSC/PAL sync depth, rejects noisy/stale evidence,
holds through signal loss and latches off on write/transport faults. Three valid
snapshots qualify bounded updates; recovery runs at 5 ms for 100 ms, then
returns to 20 ms. RF settling and lane history are excluded; each DAC entry
slews by at most 32 mV according to the loaded voltage table. Concurrent LUT arbitration and goggle
acceptance remain physical gates. It corrects output gain/offset, not IQ DC.
H/V regeneration/coasting and CPU raw-ring sync repair remain absent.
See [CVBS_LEVEL.md](CVBS_LEVEL.md) for controls, evidence and limits.
