# Isolated C5VRX-4 integration ledger

Inherit the repository attribution, hardware and evidence instructions. This
directory extends C5VRX by Twotoz and contributors; README.md and INTEGRATION.md
define its scoped defaults, donor lineage and pending physical acceptance.

Only this directory may change for this integration. Do not edit shared main,
root configuration, workflows or website to make the isolated build work.
Its main/ snapshot is intentional isolation; C5VRX-3 remains untouched. Keep
subsequent donor updates explicit in INTEGRATION_SOURCES.json.

Record source format, acquired rate, CPU/hardware ownership, raw ring, three
bundles, unique 13.333M output and physical DAC40M separately. No CPU per-sample
output, transformed ring, concurrent RX/TX BitScrambler or boundary DSP resets.

Fixed fine lanes {9,7,6,5} are default (Leon, 2026-10-04): never switch lanes
at runtime. Fixed ultrafine and protected adaptive V5 lanes are Z comparisons.
Native is opt-in and owns gain exclusively. Severe coarse or fixed-lane clipping
may cut active Direct Gain to its established G20 floor; fresh epochs and settling
refusal still apply. Manual/native never use this automatic gain response.

Sync scoring is a stride-3 semantic estimate, not tagged physical DAC output.
AFC uses adjacent raw Phase8 burst/clean-porch evidence and separate sticky video
TRACK; AUTO remains off until explicitly selected, with a bounded correction
budget. Do not use gain HOLD alone as a video lock or a CFO-write permission.

Leon explicitly authorized default-on sync-referenced CVBS level regulation on
2026-10-04 in PR164. The adaptive 5/20-ms observer uses completed IQ snapshots and bounded
DAC-only LUT16 updates after a stopped-engine addressing probe. Preserve the
explicit u opt-out, noise/context/settle refusal, loss hold and fault latch. RF SETTLE and lane-history guards must precede
qualification; recovery is bounded to 100 ms, slew to 32 mV in the loaded table.
Live RAM arbitration, waveform seams and FIFO continuity remain physical gates;
do not claim their proof from default-on authorization or host tests. H/V
regeneration and IQ DC correction remain absent. Run verify.py and exact-head
IDF CI before requesting merge approval; merge only after Leon approves.
